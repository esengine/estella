 * @file  Where every user-facing commit landed in the release notes.
 *
 * `check-release-metadata` reads the CHANGELOG's STRUCTURE — that a version has
 * a section, a compare link, a supported row. Nothing read its CONTENT, so a
 * feature could ship with no note and the release would still go out green. It
 * has happened in three releases running: v0.55 lost 31 commits across two
 * batches, 0.64 lost three, 0.66 lost the whole ECS speculation line plus the
 * editor crash fix — each found only by reading `git log` by hand.
 *
 * So say it once per commit instead. A commit that changes what a creator can
 * do names the note it landed under; one that does not says why. The gate holds
 * both directions: a missing commit fails, and so does a note title that no
 * longer exists in the CHANGELOG, which is what a rename would otherwise do
 * quietly.
